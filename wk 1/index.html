                   <p>Israel Zangwill, a playwright, disseminated the term "Melting Pot" in his play, a century ago, when he talked about the absorption of immigrants in United States, in general, and New York City in particular. New York's mosaic features many fascinating clusters of  diverse neighborhoods that formed into ethnic enclaves over the years. Visiting those neighborhoods not only takes you back in time but also transports you into different geographical locations.  "Women of NYC" offers a unique experience where various women from different cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds open their homes to give you a peek into their lives, their world and their neighborhood while sharing with you deliciously authentic home cooking from their country of origin.
               "Women of NYC" will let intellectually  curious tourists enter the most private spaces and share the most fascinating, unforgettable and once in a life time experiences of women from all over the world.</p>
